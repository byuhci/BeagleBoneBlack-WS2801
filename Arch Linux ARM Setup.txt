For now, this is just a brief record of what I had to do to get this to work so I dont' forget.

1. Find the SPIDEV0 dtc overlay in /lib/firmware.
2. Decompile
3. Adjust frequency to 1 MHz
4. Recompile
5. Test with "echo 'BB-SPIDEV0' > /sys/devices/platform/bone_capemgr/slots"
6. If ls /dev shows /dev/spidev1.0, good.
7. Add a file to /etc/tmpfiles.d/ containing 
    w /sys/devices/platform/bone_capemgr/slots - - - - BB-SPIDEV0
8. Make this executable, just in case.
9. Add a rule for udev by adding 60-spi.rules (or similar) to /etc/udev/rules.d/
    containing KERNEL=="spidev1.0", MODE="0666"
10. Reboot and check that /dev automatically contains spidev1.0 and has the 
    right permissions.
	
Note: Connect clock to pin 9.22 and MOSI to 9.18. I think 9.21 is MISO and 9.17 is probably CS.
